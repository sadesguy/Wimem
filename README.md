# Wimem
A custom made tool to help you Pentest wifis :)


Requirements: 

WIFITE: ```apt update && apt install wifite```

 -chardet
 -pytest-flake8
 -scapy
 -argparse
 ( download requirements.txt and run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```)

Enjoy? :)

if WIFITE won't work out of the box (you are probably running it from raspberryPi, aren't you?) do ```sudo cp /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/scapy/ /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/```
